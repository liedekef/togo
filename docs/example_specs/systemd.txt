Packages with systemd unit files must put them into %{_unitdir}. %{_unitdir} evaluates to /lib/systemd/system on all Fedora systems (F-15+). Unit files are architecture independent (hence, not %{_lib}) and needed early in the boot process. 

Please note that in order for the %{_unitdir} macro to exist, your package must have: 
BuildRequires: systemd

Systemd unit .service files must not be marked as %config files. 


Example spec file extract:
==========================

%{?systemd_requires}
BuildRequires: systemd

[...]
%post
%systemd_post apache-httpd.service

%preun
%systemd_preun apache-httpd.service

%postun
%systemd_postun_with_restart apache-httpd.service


Some services do not support being restarted (e.g. D-Bus and various storage daemons). If your service should not be restarted upon upgrade, then use the following %postun scriptlet instead of the one shown above: 
%postun
%systemd_postun apache-httpd.service
